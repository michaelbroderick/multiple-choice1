Code for generating comprehension and lexical identification questionaires in experiments for "Neural Markers of Comprehension for Different Levels of Speech Scrambling", Broderick, M.P. & Lalor E.C. (2020), in prep.

editPresentationCode.m edits a template for Presentation code (Neurobehavioural Systems), inserting questions and words from the stimulus folder. 

When the generated experiment and scenario files are run in Presentation, the output UI allows subjects to select checkboxes beside answer and generates log files of their results.
